 <h2> I had developed this earlier, wished i had released this sooner before the Government of India blocked all of the COWIN-API </h2>
 <h1> To run this on your computer </h1>
 <ul>
    <li> You must have a good internet connection </li>
    <li> Clone this Repository </li>
    <li> `cd Vaccine_availability` </li>
